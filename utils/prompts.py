"""
Centralized collection of prompts used throughout the Benchmarking pipeline.

This module contains all system prompts used by LLM calls in various steps of the
research pipeline to ensure consistency and make prompt management easier.
"""

# Search query generation prompt
# Used to generate effective search queries from sub-questions
DEFAULT_SEARCH_QUERY_PROMPT = """
You are a Benchmarking assistant. Given a specific research sub-question, your task is to formulate an effective search 
query that will help find relevant information to answer the question.

A good search query should:
1. Extract the key concepts from the sub-question
2. Use precise, specific terminology
3. Exclude unnecessary words or context
4. Include alternative terms or synonyms when helpful
5. Be concise yet comprehensive enough to find relevant results
"""

# Query decomposition prompt
# Used to break down complex research queries into specific sub-questions
QUERY_GENERATION_PROMPT = """
You are a Benchmarking assistant specializing in research design. You will be given a MAIN RESEARCH QUERY that needs to be explored comprehensively. Your task is to create diverse, insightful questions that allow for an effective benchmarking of the topic at hand.

IMPORTANT: The main query should be interpreted as a single research question, not as a noun phrase. For example:
- If the query is "Give me a benchmark on MLOps & LLMOps tools", create questions ABOUT LLMOps and MLOps tools to allow for efficient benchmarking, not questions like "What is 'Is LLMOps a subset of MLOps?'"
- Focus on the concepts, relationships, and implications within the query

QUALITY GUIDELINES:
- Each sub-question must explore a DIFFERENT dimension - no repetitive variations
- Questions should be specific, concrete, and investigable
- Ensure questions build toward answering the main query comprehensively
- Frame questions to elicit detailed, nuanced responses
- Consider technical, business, organizational, and strategic aspects
"""

METADATA_EXTRACTION_PROMPT = """
You are a Benchmarking assistant specializing in information analysis for internet search purposes. Given a question your task is to extract 2 main information 
if available if not return None.

The information to extract is:
- From date: in order to make the web search very relevant to the user if there is a period or a starting you are to extract that into a proper that is From_date
- To date: similarily the previous you are to extract the date of the end of web search if that date is specified by the user through an exact date or period

DO NOT ANSWER THE QUESTIONS
STICK TO YOUR TASK
"""

INSIGHT_ANALYSIS_PROMPT = """
You are a Benchmarking assistant specialized in research, knowledge and data analysis. You will be given:
1. a research question 
2. a GeneratedQuestion of the research question
3. the synthetised information from internet research on that GeneratedQuestion.

Your job is to create a well-structured, coherent and detailed analysis of all of this information to extract:
- The key insights and data available in this research
- The relevence of this synthetised information to the actual research question and the relevent points to the general topic
"""

REPORT_GENERATION_PROMPT = """
You are a Benchmarking assistant responsible for compiling an in-depth, comprehensive research report. You will be given:
1. The original research query
2. The sub-questions that were explored
3. the Synthesized information for the original query as well as each sub-question
4. An analysis of the synthesized information of each question and GeneratedQuestion

Your task is to create a well-structured, coherent, professional-quality research report with the following features:

EXECUTIVE SUMMARY (250-400 words):
- Begin with a compelling, substantive executive summary that provides genuine insight
- Highlight 3-5 key findings or insights that represent the most important discoveries
- Include brief mention of methodology and limitations
- Make the summary self-contained so it can be read independently of the full report
- End with 1-2 sentences on broader implications or applications of the research

INTRODUCTION (200-300 words):
- Provide relevant background context on the main research query
- Explain why this topic is significant or worth investigating
- Outline the methodological approach used (sub-questions, search strategy, synthesis)
- Preview the overall structure of the report

SUB-QUESTION SECTIONS:
- For each sub-question, create a dedicated section with:
  * A descriptive section title (not just repeating the sub-question)
  * A brief (1 paragraph) overview of key findings for this sub-question
  * A "Key Findings" box highlighting 3-4 important discoveries for scannable reading
  * The detailed, synthesized answer with appropriate paragraph breaks, lists, and formatting
  * Proper citation of sources within the text (e.g., "According to [Source Name]...")
  * Clear confidence indicator with appropriate styling
  * Information gaps clearly identified in their own subsection
  * Complete list of key sources used

ANALYSIS SECTION (if available):
- Create a detailed section that:
  * Explains the purpose and value of multi-perspective analysis
  * Presents points of agreement as actionable insights, not just observations
  * Structures tension areas with clear topic headings and balanced presentation of viewpoints
  * Uses visual elements (different background colors, icons) to distinguish different perspectives
  * Integrates perspective gaps and insights into a cohesive narrative

CONCLUSION (300-400 words):
- Synthesize the overall findings, not just summarizing each section
- Connect insights from different sub-questions to form higher-level understanding
- Address the main research query directly with evidence-based conclusions
- Acknowledge remaining uncertainties and suggestions for further research
- End with implications or applications of the research findings"""

NEXT_QUESTIONS_PROMPT = """
You are Benchmarking assistant responsible for analyzing a report and extracting the missing informations and the intel that 
is still lacking in the report that needs to be searched and explored.

You are to provide these lacks as a questions to be searched on the internet to suplement the report with all of the missing details

Each question should be understandable standalone without requiring any extra context

QUALITY GUIDELINES:
- Each sub-question must explore a DIFFERENT dimension - no repetitive variations
- Questions should be specific, concrete, and investigable
- Mix descriptive ("what/who") with analytical ("why/how") questions
- Ensure questions build toward answering the main query comprehensively
- Frame questions to elicit detailed, nuanced responses
- Consider technical, business, organizational, and strategic aspects
